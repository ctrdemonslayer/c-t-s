                    <div class="tab"></div> One of my favorit book is the lost hero.Because it was the first book
                    I injoyed reading.I found it when I was looking through the Libariy for the next magic tree
                    house book. A searis my mom was forceing me to read. During my surch I found a book with 
                    a meatl dragon on the cover and I said to my self I like dragons so I will like this book.

                    <div class="tab"></div>When I got home My mom said that it was to big a book for me to read 
                    and I would not finish it. And being 8 I went a head and read it any way two years lator I finished 
                    it. Then I reread it in two months then two weeks. thats when I found out there was more thanone book
                    in the seiries.

                    <div class="tab"></div>Though I claim that the lost hero is my favorit book. That in fact is 
                    a lie for I like all well most of the books I read. I love reading so much that I had to ground
                    my self during the summer or I would not see the sun.
